            <strong>Contact the lawyer holding the deceased's original signed will.</strong> Inform them you need to collect the will or have it sent to you. Inform them you are applying for probate yourself on behalf of the deceased. 
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Complete an application on this website and print the forms generated.</strong> If you cannot see the file containing the forms, check your 'Downloads' tab.
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Contact a local lawyer or Justice of the Peace (JP)</strong> and request a time to sign and swear the documents with them. Note: a lawyer may charge for this service, but a JP will not. You can find a local JP here: <a href="https://jpauckland.org.nz/locate-jp/" target="_blank">https://jpauckland.org.nz/locate-jp/</a>
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>With the lawyer or JP, sign and swear the documents.</strong> The exact details you need to complete are:
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <strong>(a)</strong> For the document titled "Application without notice for obtaining grant of probate", go to the last page (usually this will be page 3). In the presence of the JP or lawyer, the executor(s) should write their names, signatures and details in pen. In the field that says "this application is filed by", you should write your own name.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <strong>(b)</strong> For the document titled "Affidavit for obtaining grant of probate", go to the last page (this will usually be page 6). In the presence of the JP or lawyer, the executor(s) should sign on the bold lines beneath their names. The lawyer or JP should write the location where the documents are being signed, and add their signature and stamp (if they have one). They should cross out one of the options in the final line, to identify if they are a JP or a lawyer.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <strong>(c)</strong> For the document titled "Exhibit notes", the JP or lawyer should write in the location of signing and that day's date (NOT the date of the will) in the fields provided. They should then sign on the bold line and cross out one of the options in the final line, to identify if they are a JP or a lawyer.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <strong>(d)</strong> On the front page of the original will, write the capital letter A in quote marks, like this: "A".  
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <strong>(e)</strong> That is all. The document titled "Probate in common form" does NOT require any signing from you or the JP/lawyer. Do not make any further changes to the documents unless advised to by a lawyer. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Pay the court filing fee of $269.</strong> You can do so using this NZ courts website: <a href="https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/file-and-pay" target="_blank">https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/file-and-pay</a> Start the process by scrolling to the bottom and completing the online form. This will take you to a second page. <a href="filing_fee_screenshot.png" target="_blank">This screenshot shows you which options you need to select on the second page</a>. From there, completing the rest of the form is straight-forward.
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <strong>Collect the signed documents and original will.</strong> Place them in an envelope and mail them to this address:
            <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic;">
                Probate Unit<br>
                High Court<br>
                PO Box 1091<br>
                Wellington 6140
            </div>
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            You may receive a request from the courts to provide further information. You need to provide this, otherwise your application will not progress.
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            You will receive a grant of probate from the courts by mail, typically within 4-6 weeks after filing.
